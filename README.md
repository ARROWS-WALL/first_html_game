This game is japanese, so anyone who does not understand Japanese is not recommended to play this game. 
The sole objective of making this game was to help people understand the idea of UTF-8 codes (while also trying to get a pass for my IT class). 
Hence, the game revolves around decoding UTF-8 codes back into Alphabet characters. 
The objective of the game itself is to decode the monster's name by decoding the UTF-8 codes back to Alphabet characters.
Each monsters has it own time limits, and if you succeed in translating all the UTF-8 codes back to Alphabet characters within the time limit, you can proceed to the next area, which will lead to another boss fight.

you can also play from this URL: http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~t18818my/info1&2/final/index.html without having to download all the files.
Enjoy :)
